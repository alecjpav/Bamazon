Bamazon

This is an Amazon-like storefront utilizing node and MySQL database. The app is a CLI (command-line interface). It offers three views.

The customer view shows all the items for sale. The customer selects the item he wants to purchase and the quanitity. Purchasing items will deplete stock from the store's inventory. It notifies the customer of either the total of the order or that there's insufficient stock to purchase that quantity. 

The manager view allows the manager to view all stock, view low quanitity stock (stock below 5 units), add new stock to an existing item, and add a new item with price and quanitity.

The supervisor view allows the supervisor to view overhead costs, product sales and total prodit by department, as well as to create new departments that the manager can add new products under.
